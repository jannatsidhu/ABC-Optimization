Higher threats due to climate change? Most of range in U.S. under protectin status though. (CB, KVR, WE, TW, DP); Scott Wilson: For white-tailed ptarmigan, I would assign a 3 for breeding and non-breeding seasons. The main breeding risk is probably a loss of alpine habitat due to rising tree and shrub lines and I think the 3rd and 4th dashes (area-sensitive and specialized on sensitive habitats) would apply. They are more flexible in habitat use during the non-breeding period and tend to move down in elevation to partially shrubby/treed areas. These habitats may be less likely to be lost but I think weather variability with climate change becomes more of an issue in winter and sufficiently so in my opinion to assign a 3. Even if precipitation increases, the possibility of it falling more frequently as rain is a threat. 
Kathy Martin: Winter habitat may change with climate change with rising shrub and tree lines reducing amount of habitat, especially in Coastal or southern areas of the distribution. Another issue with climate driven habitat is the connection between winter and summer habitat which may also be changing with longer migration distances requited between seasons.  You likely do not want to consider conservation status of subspecies, but both ptarmigan species in NF seems to be having problems, WIPT in the Avalon may be declining because of easy access in winter by hunters, but I understand that both species are also declining on the west coast of NF where there is lower hunting pressure and less good access.
Scott: Rock ptarmigan are similar and bound to lose arctic and alpine tundra with advancing shrub lines. It s hard to say the extent to which habitat is limiting and could be lost before that would affect populations but it has to be considered a future threat, even if longer term. They would also experience similar effects of weather in the non-breeding period. Therefore, I would say 3 for them as well.

At lower elevations, they are exposed to agricultural pesticides (Graves et al. 2019, Bishop et al. 2018). In hydro right-of-ways, herbicide use and mechanical trimming are extensive, reducing nesting/foraging deciduous habitat.  BC Forest Law (Bill 70) requires stands harvested and replanted after 1987 to have commercial seedlings free from growth-inhibiting brush, weed, and excessive tree competition, and young trees must be at least as high as competing brush (native deciduous species, especially flowering shrubs and trees), with 1 m of free-growing space around their tops. This has led to young stands with no underbrush for RUHU habitat. Standard forest management does not allow seral flowers to achieve greater abundance.

A population decline of about 30% could be inferred over the last three generations, assuming that the remainder of the Canadian population has been stable. These assumptions are, however, untested.  US: Oregon breeding population estimates fell from 220 birds at 3 sites (with probable nesting at an additional 5 sites) in 1979 to 70 birds in 1988 and 20 birds at a single site in 2008 (Naughton et al. 2007; Kocourek et al. 2009). However, the latest survey used methods known to underestimate burrow-nesting birds (Kocourek et al. 2009). At Castle Rock in northern California, numbers dropped from 5638 to 86 birds between 1989 and 2007 (Carter et al. 1992; Cunha 2010).  The best trend data are from the Farallon Islands in California, where numbers of nesting birds have declined by more than 85% since 1971 (Lee et al. 2007).

Its marine range covers most of the northern Pacific Ocean, but it occurs in highest densities in areas of upwelling along shelf waters of the Pacific Rim, particularly along the coasts of Japan, eastern Russia, the Aleutians and Alaska (Piatt et al. 2006, Suryan et al. 2007). During breeding (December - May) it is found in highest densities around Japan. Satellite tracking has indicated that during the post-breeding period, females spend more time offshore of Japan and Russia, while males and juveniles spend greater time around the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea and off the coast of North America (Suryan et al. 2007).

Experimental wind turbines and a tower for wind measurements have already been built on the island, with plans to build further wind turbines in the near future. The Martin Vaz Islands have never been inhabited and are unlikely to harbour introduced mammals (Williams 1984).

",1,,Birdlife 2017,,4,Birdlife 2017,"Historically the species suffered declines through harvesting by early Polynesians and during the period of Hawaiian settlement beginning c.1,800 years ago (Carlile et al. 2003). The species may already have been restricted to its current breeding range when Europeans arrived (Carlile et al. 2003). Nesting habitat has since been lost to the pressures of modern urbanisation and degraded by feral goats and pigs and weeds. Nest burrows are trampled by feral goats, mouflon sheep and potentially chital Axis deer (spp.) (H. T. Harvey and Associates 2015, Mitchell et al. 2005). The most serious current threat is predation by introduced vertebrates including Indian mongoose Herpestes javanicus, feral cats, Barn Owls Tyto alba, rats, dogs, and pigs; presently not established on the islands of Kauai and Lanai, mongoose present an ongoing major threat to nestling and adult birds at breeding colonies on the other islands. Feral cat and rat depredation, where unmanaged on other islands, continues to limit recovery capacity. Adults and nestlings are very susceptible to predation, as nests are on the ground, and they are na ve to predators. On L?na i, habitat degradation caused by the invasive tree, strawberry guava Psidium cattleianum, is considered to be the biggest threat to the long term survival of the colony (J. Penniman in litt. 2007).",,,3,Birdlife 2017,"Each autumn during the fledging season, some of the fledgling birds become grounded as a result of light attraction and disorientation. Sometimes birds collide with sources of light and mortality sometimes occurs from collisions with fences and powerlines mostly on Kauai and Maui (Cooper and Day 1998, Simons and Hodges 1998, Simons 1985). Once on the ground, fledglings are unable to fly and are killed by cars, cats and dogs, die from environmental exposure or injuries, or are recovered by the public (H. T. Harvey and Associates 2015). Wind energy development has been occurring in Hawaii since 2005 and has caused some mortality of P. sandwichensis. The species may be adversely affected by declines in the populations of large predatory fish that drive prey species to the surface (J. Penniman in litt. 2007). In addition, a significantly lower percentage of birds come ashore to nest during El Ni o years (c.40% compared to c.65% normally) (C.N. Hodges per Carlile et al. 2003), suggesting that the species is sensitive to such disturbances in environmental conditions (Carlile et al. 2003).",,,4,BirdLife 2017,"Pterodroma sandwichensis is suspected to have declined severely for the past few centuries owing primarily to predation by introduced species at nesting colonies and urbanization (D. Ainley 2007); as well as collisions with utility structures and power lines. However, the decline is believed to have slowed and there is some indication that the population may be stable or increasing in response to management actions (D. Ainley 2007). Despite overall trends and, as evidenced by characteristics of the decline seen at the Makamakaole colony in the foothills of the West Maui Mountains, the rate of subpopulation decline probably varies considerably and is difficult to quantify. On Kaua i the population has declined significantly in the last twenty years (Raine et al. in prep.).

Global snowy owl populations probably do not exceed 14,500 pairs following a strong breeding season, and may be as low as 5,000 pairs when cyclic lemming lows are widespread (which happens more often than widely synchronized peaks).  Snowy Owls do not seem to occupy their entire breeding range each year.  As Potapov s research suggests, these ""loose boids"" (like 'mobile meta-populations') occupy each region but not in all years, moving from one region to another and leaving blanks on the distribution map.  And, there is overlap between populations of the continents with owls from Canada and Alaska moving to Siberia or elsewhere in Eurasia in other years, abandoning their previous location on the other continent.  So, Eurasian and North American populations cannot be simply summed together for a global estimate; they are not additive.

Trends were instead derived from evaluation of the 5-year population surveys across the country (2010 and 2015 national survey results are being written up for publication), with CBC used as corroboration.  The Canadian pealei population is quite small (likely <500); it has been steadily increasing too, vs. the 2013 citation in the COSEWIC report indicated a  stable  population for Alaska, so perhaps the overall trend for pealei is more of a 2, compared to a 1 for anatum/tundrius?.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,9,9,,,yes,,Widespread,Widespread,Open Country:  Habitat Mosaic,Open Country:  Developed/Disturbed,Open Country:  Habitat Mosaic,

Population stable on Cozumel (MX-NSAC); The main conservation threats throughout the range of distribution are habitat loss due to development and poorly regulated or illegal hunting (e.g., Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cayman Islands, and the Bahamas).  Poaching of nestlings is also a major threat in Hispaniola, where complete colonies have disappeared since the 1970s. Contaminants can also be important but locally (e.g., pigeons have been found dead probably from the misuse of pesticides at golf courses in Puerto Rico).
 
Unfortunately, the WCPI is heavily hunted but monitoring data are lacking and quantitative population assessments are rare in the Caribbean.  In a separate email, I will send you a report prepared for the FWS-DBHC Neotropical Migratory Bird Program.
 
In Puerto Rico, natural resource managers are concerned with illegal hunting.  (Rivera, pers. comm.. 2015).",4,M-H,4,PIFSC-08; PIFSC-CVS 2022,"DD=' threats ongoing -- presently affecting populations and likely to continue'.  BNA supports that species subject to losses of feeding habitats in woodlands due to development, residential landscape practices, hurricanes. Not clear where certain breeding; stable on Cozumel",2,H,4,Rivera/Meyer/Demarest 2015,"there are no quantitative analyses of population status and trend available for the WCPI in Florida, because survey effort has been inconsistent in terms of coverage and count methodology (e.g., see Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2011, Biological status review report for the WCPI).  In my view,  it is ""unknown"" if the WCPI population is decreasing, increasing or stable in Florida, regardless of personal opinions and observations at local scales (see pages 3 and 4 of the FWC status review report).  However, based on the scientific literature cited in that report, I agree that habitat loss due to land development is the main conservation threat to the WCPI in Florida. In Puerto Rico, natural resource managers are concerned with illegal hunting.  To address this concern, point-transect distance sampling surveys were conducted to estimate abundance (density and population size) in 1986-2014; and abundance estimates derived from these surveys were used to estimate population and management parameters (growth rate, carrying capacity, equilibrium abundance, harvest rate, total harvest) and predict changes in abundance in April-June 2025 as a function of potential harvest rate in September-November 2015-2024 (see the attached figure and table).
 
The WCPI population increased from low numbers in the 1980s most likely as a result of forest recovery in abandoned agricultural fields and cattle pastures, reaching a maximum of 83,139 individuals (SE = 11,039) in 2008. Recovery was quick from hurricanes in 1989 (Hugo) and 1998 (Georges), but the population declined sharply after 2008, reaching 14,980 individuals (SE = 1,534) in 2013.  See the attached figure.
 
Although data about illegal hunting is unavailable, an unprecedented increase in hunting activity occurred in 2008-2014, and illegal hunting is occurring even in closed areas.  For this reason, the count-based monitoring data were used to conduct a probabilistic model-based assessment of population sustainability, grounded in harvest theory, which assumed no hunting (i.e., complete management control) or hunting (partial management control) below and above the maximum sustainable yield. At least in Puerto Rico, the WCPI population showed a decline >50% between 2008 and 2014.  I cannot answer the question for other islands, although in my view it is likely that the WCPI has suffered declines >50% on islands such as Hispaniola due to habitat loss, hunting, and poaching.
