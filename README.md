## **AI Challenge: Optimizing Bird Conservation Efforts**

### **Overview**
This project was developed as part of the **American Bird Conservancy (ABC) Hackathon**, where the challenge was to predict project priorities and optimize conservation efforts for bird species at risk. I achieved a **top 3 position** for my innovative approach and impactful solution.

### **Challenge**
The primary goal of the hackathon was to:
- Prioritize conservation projects based on bird species' risk levels, population density, and associated conservation costs.
- Provide actionable insights to maximize impact within limited budgets.
- Deliver a scalable and data-driven solution for real-world conservation scenarios.

### **Solution**
I addressed the challenge by:
1. **Data Integration**: Combining 16 datasets containing information on bird species, risk factors, and conservation projects.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features like species population trends, habitat risks, and project costs.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Built a predictive model using **XGBoost** to rank project priorities.
   - Achieved a validation accuracy of 70% and test accuracy of 55.56%, ensuring a robust and reliable solution.
4. **Optimization**: Designed an optimization algorithm to allocate resources effectively across projects.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and basic modeling
  - **XGBoost**: Core predictive modeling
  - **Pandas and NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
  - **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Visualization of trends and model performance

### **Highlights**
- **Ranked Top 3**: Recognized for my data-driven approach and scalability.
- **End-to-End Solution**: Provided actionable insights for conservation decision-making.
- **Optimization Algorithm**: Efficiently allocated resources to maximize impact.

### **Presentation Resources**
- **PowerPoint Presentation**: A detailed presentation summarizing the project, approach, and results.
- **Video Presentation**: A video walkthrough of the project solution.
